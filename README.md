Project analyzing the effect of music on studying. Done in 2017 for my cognitive science class.

All of the code is in `script.py` (bad, I know, but this was several years ago and I only had to submit the research paper to my professor so I never expected anyone to see the code).

Training data is in the files labeled "Training_Data".

Cross validation data is in the files labeled "CV_Data".

Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies to run `script.py`.
